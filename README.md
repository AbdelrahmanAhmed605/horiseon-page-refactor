# Horiseon Webpage Refactor

## Description

Horiseon is a marketing agency that offers services for website optimization and management. Horiseon requested to refactor their website to ensure it is more accessible to users. As efficiency and long-term sustainability are important, the source code was also refactored to be more semantic and organized in a concise manner. This will improve their website's user comfort and allow people with disabilities to easily access the website using assistive technologies. Another added benefit of making their website more accessible is imporving their websites position in search engines such as Google.

##Lessons Learnt

In this challenge, I learnt the importance of having a semantic structure and best practices for semantic elements in html. I also learnt how to adjust css files to make them less cluttered by preventing code repitition. To prevent code repition, I used more refined css selectors. Another important lesson was how to provide comments for both html and css files. Comments helped me understand what I intended with a section of code when I viewed it a later time. It is a best practice to provide concise and descriptive comments. The final lesson learnt was how to use git commands to update my remote repository to match the changes made in my local repository. I learnt how to provide descriptive messages in the commits to allow me to understand the intention behind all my updates to the remote repository.
